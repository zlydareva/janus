                        Janus is independent magazine where we collect critical opinions on the topics of people, 
                        value, support and inspiration in the realm of art and money.We are driven by the society and searching 
                        articles that will bring you important information and provide with knowledge. We listen opinions of artists, 
                        critiques, collectors, and people who is related to the area of art and money.

                            On daily basis we pass through our fingers various banknotes and coins. We go to the museums and galleries 
                            and admire these paintings. But we never make clear connection between art, money, and us. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Janus we intend to build a strong bridge between these elements and support all aspects 
                            related to the artistic sphere.

                            We believe that people and their feelings are in the center of art. Money is a media to measure our feelings.

                        <p>
                            We apply the prism of humanity to look at our relationship with art and money to help readers to question him/herself.
